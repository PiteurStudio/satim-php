## About Satim.dz
**Satim.dz** is the leading interbank electronic payment operator in Algeria, enabling online payments through both **CIB** and **Edahabia** cards. 

The payment system operates using the robust banking technologies provided by **BPC Group**.

To learn more about Satim's API, visit the official [BPC Payment Documentation](https://dev.bpcbt.com/en/integration/api/rest/rest.html#api_overview). 

Note that many functions are restricted for public use.

### How to Get Access
To start using the Satim.dz API, youâ€™ll need to create an account via the [CIB Web Portal](https://www.cibweb.dz/). 

Once registered, you will receive your API credentials and a list of the permitted functions available for your integration.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Satim.dz API credentials (username, password, terminal ID)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require piteurstudio/satim
```

## Usage

### Generate a Payment Link

To generate a payment link, you'll need to create a new instance of the `Satim` class and provide your Satim.dz API credentials.

```php
    
use PiteurStudio\Satim;

$satim = new Satim([
    'username' => env('SATIM_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('SATIM_PASSWORD'),
    'terminal_id' => env('SATIM_TERMINAL_ID'),
]);

$payment = $satim
        ->setAmount(1000)
        ->setReturnUrl('https://example.com/success')
        ->generatePayment();

// Store this ID to check the payment status later
$orderId = $payment['orderId']; 

// Redirect your user to this URL to complete the payment
$formUrl = $payment['formUrl'];
```

### Confirm Payment Status

To check the status of a payment, you can use the `confirmOrder` method with the order ID returned from the payment link generation.

```php
    
use PiteurStudio\Satim;

/**
 * Create a new instance of the Satim class with API credentials.
 *
 * @param array $credentials An array containing 'username', 'password', and 'terminal_id'.
 */

$satim = new Satim([
    'username' => env('SATIM_USERNAME'),
    'password' => env('SATIM_PASSWORD'),
    'terminal_id' => env('SATIM_TERMINAL_ID'),
]);


$payment = $satim->confirmOrder($orderId);

if ($payment->isSuccessful()) {

    echo 'Payment was successful : '.$payment->getSuccessMessage();
    
} else {
    // Payment was not successful
    echo 'Payment was not successful' : $payment->getErrorMessage();
    
}
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
